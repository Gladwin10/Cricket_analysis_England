# Is it difficult to play in England with Heavier bats for overseas players in England?
# Bat weights (lbs) vs Runs Per Innings (RPI)
Bat weights (lbs.) vs Runs Per Innings (RPI) of Overseas players in England (Test cricket).

Runs Per Innings (RPI) is derived by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (doesn't consider Not Outs).

 Data of lot more players could be added. I have tried to get the data of all the players that use heavier bats along with some other established players that use light or medium weighed bats.
