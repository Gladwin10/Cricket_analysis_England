# Is it difficult to play in England with Heavier bats for overseas players in England (Test cricket)?

## *Relationship between Bat weights (lbs.) and Runs Per Innings (RPI) of Overseas players in England*.


Runs Per Innings (RPI) is derived by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (doesn't consider Not Outs).

 Data of lot more players could be added. I have tried to get the data of all the players that use heavier bats along with some other established players that use light or medium weighed bats.
