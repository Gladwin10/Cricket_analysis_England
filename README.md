# Hypothesis testing: It is difficult to play with heavier bats in England.

### *Relationship between Bat weights (lbs.) and Runs Per Innings (RPI) of Overseas players in England (test cricket)*.

Runs Per Innings (RPI) is derived by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (doesn't consider Not Outs). 

Bat weight can be a reason why David Warner who typically uses heavier bats failed in 2019 Ashes in England while Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith who use light weighed bats performed well. 

Sachin Tendulkar and shivnarine chanderpaul are the anomalies as they were able to score well in swinging conditions with heavier bats.

# How this study can be improved:

There are also other factors like Batter's current form, familiarity with conditions, batting positions, & movement on a particular day impacting the total runs scored. These factors can be included to enhance this test. Also, data of lot more players could be added to validate this. I have tried to get the data of the players that use heavier bats along with some other established players that use light or medium weighed bats.
