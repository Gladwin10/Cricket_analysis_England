# Is it difficult to play in England with Heavier bats for overseas players in England (Test cricket)?

## *Relationship between Bat weights (lbs.) and Runs Per Innings (RPI) of Overseas players in England*.

Runs Per Innings (RPI) is derived by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (doesn't consider Not Outs). 

## Sachin Tendulkar and shivnarine chanderpaul are the anomalies as they were able to score well in swinging conditions with heavier bats.

Bat weight can also be a reason why David Warner who typically uses heavier bats failed in 2019 Ashes in England while Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith who use light weighed bats performed well. 

Data of lot more players could be added. I have tried to get the data of the players that use heavier bats along with some other established players that use light or medium weighed bats.
